        <h3 class="ptitle">Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning</h3>
        <img src="project2.png" alt="Project 2">
        <p>Diabetes prediction using machine learning is a project aimed at building a predictive model to identify individuals at high risk of developing diabetes. The model is created using various machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, and artificial neural networks, and is trained on a dataset consisting of various demographic and clinical features such as age, body mass index (BMI), glucose levels, blood pressure, family history, and lifestyle factors. The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately predict the onset of diabetes, which can help healthcare providers identify at-risk individuals early and take preventive measures to minimize the risk of developing diabetes. The project has the potential to improve diabetes prevention and management, leading to better health outcomes for individuals and reducing the economic burden of diabetes on healthcare systems.</p>

        <p>An Inventory Management System is a software application that helps businesses to manage and track their inventory levels, orders, sales, and other related information. This system is designed using HTML, CSS, PHP, and a database to store and retrieve data. The HTML and CSS are used to create a user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with the system easily. The PHP programming language is used to write the business logic that handles the inventory data, such as adding new products, updating inventory levels, and generating reports. The database is used to store all the data related to the inventory, such as product details, sales records, and customer information. Overall, this project can help businesses to streamline their inventory management process, reduce manual errors, and make data-driven decisions based on real-time information.</p>
